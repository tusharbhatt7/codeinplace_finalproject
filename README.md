# Music Recommender Tool - Final Project at Code in Place 2021 (Stanford University)

## Description
This is my final project for the special online course Code in Place 2021 by Stanford University. This Python program uses core concepts from Code in Place's course lectures such as variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, and random library.

"Music recommender tool" gives a user random songs from its dataset by:
- First, asking for number of song(s) the user wants to receive
- Second, asking the user to select a song recommendation mode from 4 modes: Emotion, Genre, Occasion, Random
- Then, if user chooses "Random" mode, the program will return randomized songs from all songs in the dataset, based on the number of songs they indicated in the first step.
- If user chooses either "Emotion", "Genre", or "Occasion" mode, the program asks user to select a specific sub-category within that mode before returning randomized songs from the corresponding sub-category.

## Instructions
Install the "Final-Project.py" file and run the program locally. Some activities you can do with the program are:
- Add or change the song database directly in the Python code
- Run the program and enter your input as asked to get randomized songs based on your choice of recommendation modes and sub-categories.

## Other information
I am very grateful for the great learning experience with the professors, section leaders, and classmates of Code in Place 2021.

I am a beginner in Python/programming learning, so the project is pretty straightforward and simple. I hope to receive your feedback on my code.
